# GETAWebAPI
A sample HTML page that reads data from an API and displays it on a table. 

Basically I am reading the public API that displays a list of ships in the movie Starwars using this link: https://swapi.co/api/starships/. I had issues reading from the API today hence created a sample JSON file that is returning the data and read data from that file. 

The code consists of just 3 files: index.html, javascript.js and styles.css. Its very easy to run the files once you download to your desktop. 
Just save all the files into a folder and run the index.html. 

There is also a word document that is attached, which shows my effort for Task 1 and Task3. Kindly go through that one too separately.
